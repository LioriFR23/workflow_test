# Terraform Text File Generator

This Terraform configuration creates a single text file using the `local_file` resource.

## Description

This simple Terraform template demonstrates how to create a text file with static content and a dynamic timestamp. The file will be created in the same directory as the Terraform configuration.

## Files

- `main.tf` - Main Terraform configuration file that defines the text file resource

## Resources Created

- **local_file.text_file** - Creates a text file named `sample.txt` with predefined content including a timestamp

## Requirements

- Terraform >= 1.0
- Local provider ~> 2.0

## Usage

### Initialize Terraform
```bash
terraform init
```

### Plan the deployment
```bash
terraform plan
```

### Apply the configuration
```bash
terraform apply
```

### View outputs
```bash
terraform output
```

### Destroy resources
```bash
terraform destroy
```

## Outputs

- `file_path` - The full path to the created text file
- `file_content` - The content of the created text file

## Customization

You can customize the following aspects:

1. **File content**: Modify the `content` attribute in the `local_file` resource
2. **File name**: Change the `filename` attribute to specify a different file name or path
3. **File permissions**: Add a `file_permission` attribute to set specific file permissions

## Example Customizations

### Custom content and filename
```hcl
resource "local_file" "text_file" {
  content  = "Custom content here"
  filename = "${path.module}/custom-file.txt"
  file_permission = "0644"
}
```

### Dynamic content with variables
```hcl
variable "file_content" {
  description = "Content for the text file"
  type        = string
  default     = "Default content"
}

resource "local_file" "text_file" {
  content  = var.file_content
  filename = "${path.module}/dynamic.txt"
}
```

## Notes

- The file will be created in the same directory as your Terraform configuration
- The timestamp in the content will be updated each time you run `terraform apply`
- The file will be deleted when you run `terraform destroy`

# Simple Terraform Text File Generator

This Terraform configuration creates a simple text file using the `local_file` resource.

## What it does

- Creates a text file named `output.txt` in the current directory
- Adds sample content including a timestamp
- Outputs the file path and content for verification

## Prerequisites

- Terraform installed (version 0.12 or higher)

## Files

- `main.tf` - Main Terraform configuration file

## Usage

### Initialize Terraform
```bash
terraform init
```

### Plan the deployment
```bash
terraform plan
```

### Apply the configuration
```bash
terraform apply
```

### Destroy the resources
```bash
terraform destroy
```

## Outputs

After running `terraform apply`, you will see:
- `file_path` - The full path to the created text file
- `file_content` - The content that was written to the file

## Customization

You can modify the following in `main.tf`:
- Change the `content` value to customize the text file content
- Change the `filename` to specify a different file name or path
- Add more `local_file` resources to create multiple files

## Example Output

After running `terraform apply`, a file named `output.txt` will be created with content similar to:
```
Hello World!
This is a simple text file created by Terraform.
Timestamp: 2024-01-15T10:30:45Z
```

## Notes

- The `timestamp()` function generates a new timestamp each time Terraform runs
- The file will be recreated if the content changes
- Use `terraform show` to see the current state of resources

# Simple Text File Terraform Template

This Terraform template demonstrates how to create a simple text file using the `local_file` resource.

## What it does

- Creates a text file named `example.txt` in the current directory
- Adds sample content including a timestamp
- Outputs the file path and content for verification

## Prerequisites

- Terraform installed (version 0.12 or later)
- No cloud provider credentials needed (uses local provider)

## Files Structure

```
.
├── main.tf          # Main Terraform configuration
├── example.txt      # Generated text file (after apply)
└── README.md        # This documentation
```

## Usage

### Initialize Terraform
```bash
terraform init
```

### Plan the deployment
```bash
terraform plan
```

### Apply the configuration
```bash
terraform apply
```

### Destroy the resources
```bash
terraform destroy
```

## Customization

You can customize the template by modifying:

- **File content**: Change the `content` parameter in the `local_file` resource
- **File name**: Modify the `filename` parameter
- **File location**: Update the path in the `filename` parameter

### Example customizations:

```hcl
# Create multiple files
resource "local_file" "config_file" {
  content  = "server_port=8080\ndebug=true"
  filename = "${path.module}/config.properties"
}

# Create file with variables
variable "app_name" {
  description = "Application name"
  type        = string
  default     = "my-app"
}

resource "local_file" "app_config" {
  content  = "app_name=${var.app_name}\nversion=1.0.0"
  filename = "${path.module}/${var.app_name}-config.txt"
}
```

## Outputs

After applying, you'll see:
- `file_path`: The full path to the created file
- `file_content`: The content that was written to the file

## Notes

- The `local_file` resource is part of the `local` provider
- The file will be created relative to where you run Terraform
- Use `${path.module}` to ensure consistent file placement
- The `timestamp()` function adds a unique timestamp each time you apply
