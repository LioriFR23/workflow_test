# Simple Text Fire Terraform Template

This Terraform template creates a simple "text fire" web application running on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

## What it creates

- A single GCP Compute Engine instance (e2-micro)
- A Python Flask web application that displays animated fire text
- Firewall rules to allow HTTP traffic on port 80

## Prerequisites

- Terraform installed
- Google Cloud SDK installed and authenticated
- A GCP project with Compute Engine API enabled

## Usage

1. Initialize Terraform:
```bash
terraform init
```

2. Set your project ID:
```bash
export TF_VAR_project_id="your-gcp-project-id"
```

3. Plan the deployment:
```bash
terraform plan
```

4. Apply the configuration:
```bash
terraform apply
```

5. Access your text fire application using the output IP address in your browser.

## Variables

- `project_id`: Your GCP project ID (required)
- `region`: GCP region (default: us-central1)
- `zone`: GCP zone (default: us-central1-a)

## Cleanup

To destroy the resources:
```bash
terraform destroy
```

## Example

After deployment, visit `http://[INSTANCE_IP]` to see the animated text fire effect.

# Simple Text File Terraform Template

This Terraform template creates a simple text file using the `local_file` resource. It demonstrates basic Terraform functionality for file creation and management.

## What This Template Does

- Creates a simple text file named `output.txt` in the current directory
- Includes dynamic content with a timestamp
- Outputs the file path and content for verification

## Prerequisites

- Terraform >= 1.0 installed
- No cloud provider credentials required (uses local provider only)

## File Structure

```
.
├── main.tf          # Main Terraform configuration
├── output.txt       # Generated text file (created after apply)
└── README.md        # This documentation
```

## Usage Commands

### Initialize Terraform
```bash
terraform init
```

### Plan the deployment
```bash
terraform plan
```

### Apply the configuration
```bash
terraform apply
```

### View outputs
```bash
terraform output
```

### Destroy resources
```bash
terraform destroy
```

## Example Output

After running `terraform apply`, you will see:
- A file named `output.txt` created in your current directory
- Terraform outputs showing the file path and content

## Customization

You can modify the following in `main.tf`:
- **File content**: Change the `content` attribute in the `local_file` resource
- **File name**: Modify the `filename` attribute
- **File location**: Update the path in the `filename` attribute

## Example Modifications

### Custom content:
```hcl
content = "Your custom text here\nLine 2\nLine 3"
```

### Different filename:
```hcl
filename = "${path.module}/my-custom-file.txt"
```

### Multiple files:
Add additional `local_file` resources with different names and content.
