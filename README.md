# Simple Text Fire Terraform Template

This Terraform template creates a simple "text fire" web application running on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

## What it creates

- A single GCP Compute Engine instance (e2-micro)
- A Python Flask web application that displays animated fire text
- Firewall rules to allow HTTP traffic on port 80

## Prerequisites

- Terraform installed
- Google Cloud SDK installed and authenticated
- A GCP project with Compute Engine API enabled

## Usage

1. Initialize Terraform:
```bash
terraform init
```

2. Set your project ID:
```bash
export TF_VAR_project_id="your-gcp-project-id"
```

3. Plan the deployment:
```bash
terraform plan
```

4. Apply the configuration:
```bash
terraform apply
```

5. Access your text fire application using the output IP address in your browser.

## Variables

- `project_id`: Your GCP project ID (required)
- `region`: GCP region (default: us-central1)
- `zone`: GCP zone (default: us-central1-a)

## Cleanup

To destroy the resources:
```bash
terraform destroy
```

## Example

After deployment, visit `http://[INSTANCE_IP]` to see the animated text fire effect.
