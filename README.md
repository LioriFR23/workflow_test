# Terraform Text File Generator

This Terraform configuration creates a single text file using the `local_file` resource.

## Description

This simple Terraform template demonstrates how to create a text file with static content and a dynamic timestamp. The file will be created in the same directory as the Terraform configuration.

## Files

- `main.tf` - Main Terraform configuration file that defines the text file resource

## Resources Created

- **local_file.text_file** - Creates a text file named `sample.txt` with predefined content including a timestamp

## Requirements

- Terraform >= 1.0
- Local provider ~> 2.0

## Usage

### Initialize Terraform
```bash
terraform init
```

### Plan the deployment
```bash
terraform plan
```

### Apply the configuration
```bash
terraform apply
```

### View outputs
```bash
terraform output
```

### Destroy resources
```bash
terraform destroy
```

## Outputs

- `file_path` - The full path to the created text file
- `file_content` - The content of the created text file

## Customization

You can customize the following aspects:

1. **File content**: Modify the `content` attribute in the `local_file` resource
2. **File name**: Change the `filename` attribute to specify a different file name or path
3. **File permissions**: Add a `file_permission` attribute to set specific file permissions

## Example Customizations

### Custom content and filename
```hcl
resource "local_file" "text_file" {
  content  = "Custom content here"
  filename = "${path.module}/custom-file.txt"
  file_permission = "0644"
}
```

### Dynamic content with variables
```hcl
variable "file_content" {
  description = "Content for the text file"
  type        = string
  default     = "Default content"
}

resource "local_file" "text_file" {
  content  = var.file_content
  filename = "${path.module}/dynamic.txt"
}
```

## Notes

- The file will be created in the same directory as your Terraform configuration
- The timestamp in the content will be updated each time you run `terraform apply`
- The file will be deleted when you run `terraform destroy`

# Simple Text File Terraform Template

This Terraform template creates a simple text file using the `local_file` resource provider.

## Description

The template creates a text file named `output.txt` in the current directory with some sample content including a timestamp.

## Files

- `main.tf` - Main Terraform configuration file that defines the text file resource

## Requirements

- Terraform >= 0.12
- No additional providers required (uses built-in `local` provider)

## Usage

### Initialize Terraform
```bash
terraform init
```

### Plan the deployment
```bash
terraform plan
```

### Apply the configuration
```bash
terraform apply
```

### Destroy the resources
```bash
terraform destroy
```

## What it creates

- A text file named `output.txt` in the same directory as the Terraform files
- The file contains:
  - "Hello World!" message
  - A description line
  - A timestamp of when it was created

## Outputs

- `file_path` - Shows the full path to the created file
- `file_content` - Shows the content of the created file

## Customization

You can modify the following in `main.tf`:
- Change the `content` to include your desired text
- Modify the `filename` to change the output file name or location
- Add additional `local_file` resources to create multiple files

## Example Output

After running `terraform apply`, you'll see output similar to:
```
file_content = "Hello World!
This is a simple text file created by Terraform.
Timestamp: 2024-01-15T10:30:45Z"
file_path = "./output.txt"
```
