# Terraform Text File Generator

This Terraform configuration creates a single text file using the `local_file` resource.

## Description

This simple Terraform template demonstrates how to create a text file with static content and a dynamic timestamp. The file will be created in the same directory as the Terraform configuration.

## Files

- `main.tf` - Main Terraform configuration file that defines the text file resource

## Resources Created

- **local_file.text_file** - Creates a text file named `sample.txt` with predefined content including a timestamp

## Requirements

- Terraform >= 1.0
- Local provider ~> 2.0

## Usage

### Initialize Terraform
```bash
terraform init
```

### Plan the deployment
```bash
terraform plan
```

### Apply the configuration
```bash
terraform apply
```

### View outputs
```bash
terraform output
```

### Destroy resources
```bash
terraform destroy
```

## Outputs

- `file_path` - The full path to the created text file
- `file_content` - The content of the created text file

## Customization

You can customize the following aspects:

1. **File content**: Modify the `content` attribute in the `local_file` resource
2. **File name**: Change the `filename` attribute to specify a different file name or path
3. **File permissions**: Add a `file_permission` attribute to set specific file permissions

## Example Customizations

### Custom content and filename
```hcl
resource "local_file" "text_file" {
  content  = "Custom content here"
  filename = "${path.module}/custom-file.txt"
  file_permission = "0644"
}
```

### Dynamic content with variables
```hcl
variable "file_content" {
  description = "Content for the text file"
  type        = string
  default     = "Default content"
}

resource "local_file" "text_file" {
  content  = var.file_content
  filename = "${path.module}/dynamic.txt"
}
```

## Notes

- The file will be created in the same directory as your Terraform configuration
- The timestamp in the content will be updated each time you run `terraform apply`
- The file will be deleted when you run `terraform destroy`

# Simple Terraform Text File Generator

This Terraform configuration creates a simple text file using the `local_file` resource.

## What it does

- Creates a text file named `output.txt` in the current directory
- Adds sample content including a timestamp
- Outputs the file path and content for verification

## Prerequisites

- Terraform installed (version 0.12 or higher)

## Files

- `main.tf` - Main Terraform configuration file

## Usage

### Initialize Terraform
```bash
terraform init
```

### Plan the deployment
```bash
terraform plan
```

### Apply the configuration
```bash
terraform apply
```

### Destroy the resources
```bash
terraform destroy
```

## Outputs

After running `terraform apply`, you will see:
- `file_path` - The full path to the created text file
- `file_content` - The content that was written to the file

## Customization

You can modify the following in `main.tf`:
- Change the `content` value to customize the text file content
- Change the `filename` to specify a different file name or path
- Add more `local_file` resources to create multiple files

## Example Output

After running `terraform apply`, a file named `output.txt` will be created with content similar to:
```
Hello World!
This is a simple text file created by Terraform.
Timestamp: 2024-01-15T10:30:45Z
```

## Notes

- The `timestamp()` function generates a new timestamp each time Terraform runs
- The file will be recreated if the content changes
- Use `terraform show` to see the current state of resources

# Simple Text File Terraform Template

This Terraform template creates a simple text file using the `local_file` resource.

## What it does

- Creates a text file named `simple.txt` in the current directory
- Adds basic content to the file
- Outputs the file path and content for reference

## Files

- `main.tf` - Main Terraform configuration file

## Requirements

- Terraform >= 0.12
- No additional providers required (uses built-in `local` provider)

## Usage

### Initialize Terraform
```bash
terraform init
```

### Plan the deployment
```bash
terraform plan
```

### Apply the configuration
```bash
terraform apply
```

### Destroy the resources
```bash
terraform destroy
```

## Customization

You can customize the file by modifying the `local_file` resource in `main.tf`:

- Change the `content` to modify what's written in the file
- Change the `filename` to create the file with a different name or location

### Example: Custom content
```hcl
resource "local_file" "simple_txt" {
  content  = "Your custom content here\nLine 2\nLine 3"
  filename = "${path.module}/my-custom-file.txt"
}
```

## Outputs

After applying, Terraform will output:
- `file_path`: The full path to the created file
- `file_content`: The content that was written to the file

## Notes

- The file will be created in the same directory as your Terraform configuration
- If the file already exists, Terraform will overwrite it
- The file will be deleted when you run `terraform destroy`

# Terraform AWS Infrastructure

This Terraform configuration creates a basic AWS infrastructure including VPC, subnets, internet gateway, route tables, and security groups.

## Architecture

The infrastructure includes:
- **VPC**: A Virtual Private Cloud with CIDR block 10.0.0.0/16
- **Public Subnets**: 2 public subnets in different availability zones (10.0.1.0/24, 10.0.2.0/24)
- **Private Subnets**: 2 private subnets in different availability zones (10.0.10.0/24, 10.0.11.0/24)
- **Internet Gateway**: Provides internet access to public subnets
- **Route Tables**: Configured for public subnet internet routing
- **Security Group**: Web security group allowing HTTP, HTTPS, and internal SSH access

## Prerequisites

- Terraform >= 1.0
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- AWS account with necessary permissions

## Usage

### Initialize Terraform
```bash
terraform init
```

### Plan the deployment
```bash
terraform plan
```

### Apply the configuration
```bash
terraform apply
```

### Destroy the infrastructure
```bash
terraform destroy
```

## Customization

You can customize the deployment by modifying the variables:

```bash
# Set custom region
terraform apply -var="aws_region=us-east-1"

# Set custom environment
terraform apply -var="environment=production"

# Set custom project name
terraform apply -var="project_name=my-app"
```

## Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `aws_region` | AWS region for deployment | `us-west-2` |
| `environment` | Environment name (dev, staging, prod) | `dev` |
| `project_name` | Project name for resource naming | `my-project` |

## Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `vpc_id` | The ID of the created VPC |
| `public_subnet_ids` | List of public subnet IDs |
| `private_subnet_ids` | List of private subnet IDs |
| `security_group_id` | ID of the web security group |

## Security Considerations

- The security group allows HTTP/HTTPS access from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0)
- SSH access is restricted to the VPC CIDR block
- Private subnets have no direct internet access
- Consider implementing NAT Gateway for private subnet internet access if needed

## Next Steps

After deploying this infrastructure, you can:
1. Launch EC2 instances in the subnets
2. Set up load balancers
3. Configure RDS databases in private subnets
4. Add NAT Gateway for private subnet internet access
5. Implement additional security groups as needed
